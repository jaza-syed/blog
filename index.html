<h2><b>half hour vignettes on a borrowed thinkpad</b></h2>

<section>
<p>I'm Jaza Syed, a software developer and former engineering student.</p>
<p>I'll be using this space to write about what I'm up to and miscellaneous things I've been finding interesting.</p>
<p>The blog title is a play on the title of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRXjAZJVkpY">this</a> track by <a href="https://amadeupsound.bandcamp.com/">A Made Up Sound</a>. Some posts may have taken longer than half an hour to write. </p>
<p>The site has been generated with <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">tufte-css</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> - which is a stack inspired/stolen from my friend <a href="http://soup.agnescameron.info">Agnes</a>. It's best viewed on desktop for now.</p>
<p>A copy of my CV is <a href="{{  '/rsc/2022-08-24_CV_JAZA-SYED.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a> and I can be contacted reliably at <a href="mailto:jaza.syed@icloud.com">jaza.syed@icloud.com</a>. I can also be found on <a href="https://github.com/jaza-syed">github</a>.</p>
